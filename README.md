# PSHEventManager

PSHEventManager is ASP.net MVC core project to manage local events. Users can create own events and shared by other members. 
Users can join events and that event can be shared by the other members. 

This project can be a good boilerplate to start a ASP.net core MVC or Web API projects. 

I will expand more features with good sample of UI.
